## COMBAT

Combat is made in turns. Every character in combat can do 1 action per turn. Actions can be:

* Move

* Melee attack

* Ranged attack

* Cast spell

* Consume item (e.g. drink potion, use scroll, etc...)

For physical attack a d20 roll is made, based on the result the following happens

* 0: a critical miss

* 20: a critical hit, the actor deals maximum damage

* 1-19: perform a damage roll to determine damage done, the damage roll is based on weapon damage, possibly modified by other stats (e.g. a 1-handed melee weapon adds STR, a 2-handed melee weapon adds 2x STR, etc ...)


## EXPLORATION

For the map we will use a square based system. 1 square is equal to 5 feet or about 1.5 meters. Base movement speed is 30 feet per combat round, but this is reduced to 20 feet for medium or heavy armoured characters. 

A character can see 60 feet away in daylight conditions. In a dungeon with a light source a human character can see 30 yards away. 

In combat, adjacent units can perform an attack of opportunity if a character is moving away.
