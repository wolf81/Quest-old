Combat is made in turns. Every character in combat can do 1 action per turn. Actions can be:

* Move

* Melee attack

* Ranged attack

* Cast spell

* Consume item (e.g. drink potion, use scroll, etc...)


## MAP

For the map we will use a square based system. 1 square is equal to 5 feet. Base speed is 30 feet per combat round, but this is reduced to 20 feet for medium or heavy armoured characters. Outside of combat the speed will be 30 feet.

In combat, adjacent units can perform an attack of opportunity if a character is moving away.
